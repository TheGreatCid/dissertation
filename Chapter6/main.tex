In this dissertation, the variational approach to fracture is extended to account for general dissipative solids and different types of fracture. Several models are constructed within the proposed variational framework to study practical engineering problems.

In \Cref{section: Chapter3}, a model for brittle/quasi-brittle fracture is developed to investigate fracture evolution in microscale. 3D numerical studies are performed to investigate the effect of bubble geometry, porosity and loading conditions on the critical fracture strength. The bubble geometry affects the fracture stress by changing the stress concentration near the bubble and grain boundary interface. Loading conditions also make an important impact on the critical fracture strength -- with multiple loading directions, the critical fracture strength appears to be lower. Intergranular crack propagation simulations have been performed considering different porosity levels. The variation of the critical fracture strength with porosity has been then compared with experimental measurements. 3D simulation results show a better agreement with the experiment data than the previous 2D results. The model is then extended to account for pressurized cracks. The model is proven to be capable of reflecting fine fragmentation phenomena and providing insights into the mechanisms of HBS fine fragmentation. Simulations show that fracture occurs along the grain boundaries surrounding the large fission gas bubbles, which agrees with the hypothesized mechanism of fine fragmentation during LOCA transients. Bubble size and the amount of external pressure will change the critical pressure for crack initiation. Crack propagation at different recrystallization stages on a partial HBS is also investigated using this model. The recrystallization changes the grain structure, thus altering crack propagation paths and directions.

In \Cref{section: Chapter4}, a model for cohesive fracture is used to study soil dessication. A novel split of the elastic potential is proposed to account for the external work done by contact forces on regularized crack surfaces. Such split results in a constitutive relation that naturally enforces the traction-free boundary condition and contact condition at the vicinity of the cracks. Necessity of the contact split in systems subject to shear loading or even purely tensile loading is demonstrated in \Cref{section: Chapter4/verification}. We then develop a stochastic model for the random field of fracture properties in \Cref{section: Chapter4/theory/stochastic}. The representation enables the integration of pointwise correlation between the fracture toughness and the critical fracture energy, and two prototypical covariance models are specifically considered to offer modeling flexibility.
The variational phase-field fracture model with the proposed contact split is then applied to study thin-film fracture. Qualitative agreement with analytical solution is established using a quasi one-dimensional simplification. A two-dimensional plane-stress model is subsequently used to explore the effect of random fracture properties on crack morphology. Forward propagation problems are first considered to study the effect of kernel smoothness, correlation length, and pointwise correlation between the fracture properties. In particular, it is observed that (1) smooth fracture properties result in larger fragment sizes (in mean); (2) the crack path is mainly influenced by the spatial variations of the fracture toughness, rather than fluctuations in the critical fracture energy; and (3) different compositions of covariance functions can result in dramatically different crack patterns. Finally, the versatility offered by the probabilistic framework is highlighted by solving a statistical inverse problem based on physical experiments. Despite the apparent simplicity of the identification methodology, it is seen that the stochastic phase-field formulation allows key characteristics of observed crack patterns to be reproduced with reasonable accuracy, hence paving the way for future developments coupling fracture simulations with experimental results exhibiting substantial variability.

In \Cref{section: Chapter5}, several models for ductile fracture are constructed within the variational framework. The framework provides two mechanisms for coupling  plasticity and fracture, either using the plastic degradation function (E-P-PD) or through the coalescence dissipation (E-P-D). The proposed E-P-D model using this novel coalescence dissipation was compared with the E-P-PD model from \cite{brandon2020cohesive}.
Several important modeling choices are discussed in \Cref{section: Chapter5/verification/homogenized} in a ``homogenized'' setting:
A crack geometric function $\alpha(d; \xi > 0)$ allows for an unperturbed elastic-plastic response prior to damage initiation (\Cref{section: Chapter5/verification/homogenized/alpha});
a Lorentz-type degradation function separates out the critical fracture energy as an independent material property such that a regularization-length independent finite critical fracture strength can be obtained (\Cref{section: Chapter5/verification/homogenized/degradation});
the decrease in the fracture toughness as a function of the increasing plastic strain can be modeled using the proposed coalescence dissipation (\Cref{section: Chapter5/verification/homogenized/coalescence}).
Convergence of the softening response is numerically demonstrated in \Cref{section: Chapter5/verification/nonhomogeneous}.
The force-displacement responses obtained using both the proposed E-P-D model and the E-P-PD model presented in \cite{brandon2020cohesive} become insensitive to the regularization length as the regularization length is sufficiently small, regardless of the amount of coalescence dissipation.
The performance of the proposed E-P-D model is evaluated by simulating a three-point bending experiment in \Cref{section: Chapter5/examples/3pb}. The model is first calibrated against a standard tension test of a notched specimen, and then applied to predict the crack path and load-deflection response of the aluminum alloy specimen in the three-point bending experiment.
The predicted load-deflection curves and crack trajectories are found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, the capabilities of the proposed E-P-PD model are examined by simulating an experiment from a recent Sandia Fracture Challenge. Both the predicted force-displacement response and the crack path indicate an excellent agreement with the experimental observations.
