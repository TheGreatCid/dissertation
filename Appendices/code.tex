Most calculations in this dissertation are carried out using RACCOON \cite{raccoon,raccoon_doc}, a software package specialized in phase-field for fracture. RACCOON is developed based on the MOOSE framework \cite{moose_inl}. MOOSE stands for Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment and is being actively developed and maintained by the Idaho National Laboratory. Both RACCOON and MOOSE are open-source projects.

Reproducibility crisis is a common issue in many communities, and the computational mechanics community is of no exception. As an attempt to address such issue, both RACCOON and MOOSE are being continuously tested using CIVET \cite{slaughter2021continuous}. Most, if not all, models, verifications and numerical examples are available in the format of input files in the RACCOON GitHub repository.
